        <p id = "abt-tyler-descr">Born in 2003, Tyler was raised into a life of music and began guitar lessons very early on. Tyler was heavily involved in choir and other band programs up until college. He made the switch from studying music to engineering and physics, but would ultimately drop out of college to pursue a career in software development. But as Newtons 3rd Law describes, "A body born in Rock & Roll, will remain in Rock & Roll." Tyler is a founding member of Rock Crown and is one of the primary songwriters. Tyler is also the lead guitarist and backing vocalist.</p>

        <p id = "abt-jeremy-descr">The founding member of Rock Crown, Jeremy Rowling serves the band with guitar and lead vocals. Rowling started playing guitar and writing songs at the age of 12. Later on he would become the primary songwriter in Rock Crown. Rowling has grown to love all different genres of music which has helped his venture as a songwriter. Mainly being influenced by rock and roll, it is not uncommon to hear Jeremy blasting Outkast, The Band, George Strait or Billie Eilish.</p>

        <p id = "abt-nevan-descr">Spending his highschool career juggling baseball and band class, Nevan learned a thing or two about being a team player. While a guitarist by trade, McDuffie first showed his commitment to Rock Crown when he offered to fill the role of bassist. Laying down the grove it was clear that Nevan was not only a team player, but a fantastic musician. When his time as bassist was up Nevan made the switch to guitar and gave the band the gift of funk.</p>
